My project will explore the intricate connection between urban mobility patterns and environmental sustainability. The primary hypothesis is that analysis of urban mobility 
data can show correlations between sustainable practices and key environmental indicators. The primary environmental indicator I will use is the air quality and amount of
emissions a city produces. Key variables for the data include types of transportation and proximity to public transportation, with environmental indicators such as air 
quality and carbon emissions as dependent variables. 

I expect that the data will show that there is a correlation between cities that have better access to public transportation and their amount of emissions. I will have to 
account for factors such as population and city density when it comes to a city's emissions since they will undoubtedly have a correlation.
