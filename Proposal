My hypothesis for my project is that The environmental sustainability of urban areas is intricately linked to mobility patterns. By analyzing urban mobility data that encompasses public transportation usage, traffic congestion metrics, and bike-sharing patterns, we can see how these modes of transportation affect the ecological impact of a city. I am going to get my data from the government of Canada's website for the air pollution effects in different provinces as well as the data portal for cities to get the transportation data.

I expect that the more public transportation options are available the more they will be used and therefore the amount of pollution created by cars will be decreased. The amount will vary with the modes of transportation, with vehicles like buses still producing some pollution compared to bike-sharing programs.
